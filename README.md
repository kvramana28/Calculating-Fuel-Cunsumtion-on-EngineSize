 # Calculating Fuel Consumption Based on Engine Size

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between a vehicle's **engine size** and its **fuel consumption** using real-world vehicle data. By examining patterns and building predictive models, it aims to understand how engine capacity affects fuel efficiency and emissions.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- **`FuelConsumption.csv`** – Dataset containing vehicle specifications such as engine size, fuel consumption, and CO₂ emissions.
- **`project (1).ipynb`** – Jupyter Notebook with data analysis, visualizations, and regression modeling to study the relationship between engine size and fuel consumption.

## ⚙️ Features
- Data loading and cleaning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with charts and statistics.
- Correlation analysis between engine size and fuel consumption.
- Linear regression model to predict fuel consumption from engine size.
- Visual representation of results.

## 📊 Dataset Information
The dataset includes:
- Engine Size (L)
- Fuel Consumption (City, Highway, Combined)
- CO₂ Emissions (g/km)
- Other vehicle attributes

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kvramana28/Calculating-Fuel-Cunsumtion-on-EngineSize.git
